## Proof of Location on Blockchain
### Overview
"Location on Chain" is a decentralized system that verifies the location of participants in real-time using blockchain technology. This concept is designed to ensure the accuracy and integrity of location-based services, such as delivery systems and public transportation, by securely logging and verifying the geolocation of users on the blockchain.I also allows for location based activation of smart contracts

### Key Features
Decentralized Location Verification: Leverages blockchain for immutable and transparent location verification.
Off-Chain Distance Calculation: Efficiently handles complex geolocation calculations off-chain and submits verified results to the blockchain.
Automated Smart Contracts: Facilitates automatic contract execution and payment release based on verified location data.
Secure and Transparent: Ensures data integrity and transparency, minimizing fraud and disputes.
### How It Works
Start Location: The sender initiates the process by setting their starting location.
DeliveryMedium: the delivery person or vehicle  
End Location: The receiver sets the delivery or endpoint location after the transaction is completed.
Off-Chain Calculation: A backend service calculates the distance between the deliveryMedium and endLocation.
Oracle Integration: The calculated distance is sent to the smart contract using an oracle.
Validation: The smart contract verifies whether the distance is within the acceptable range.
Payment Release: If the distance is validated, the payment is automatically released to the relevant parties.

### Example Use Case
1. Delivery Apps
In the logistics and delivery sector, ensuring that goods are delivered to the correct location is paramount. This Proof of Location system can be integrated into delivery apps to:

Verify Deliveries: Ensure that packages are delivered to the correct address by validating the proximity of the delivery personnel to the recipient.
Automate Payments: Release payments to delivery personnel only when the delivery is confirmed through verified geolocation data.
Enhance Trust: Provide transparency to customers and businesses by recording delivery events on the blockchain.
